<h1>React Lazy loading Demo</h1>

Lazy loading is an old technique to optimize web applications and mobile apps. It will not render the things that are not viewed or required at the moment.
Rendering unseen components harm's the application's performance and wastes resources. People do not like to wait for pages to load!

For really large images, this app loads a lower quality image (as a placeholder) before loading the actual large image for better speeds.

- Reads in data from data.js
- Uses LazyLoad component from 'react-lazyload'
- Spinning icon using svg
